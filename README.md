# CG-Project

The end of the semester is coming and the deadlines come with it. The teams are struggling to finish their projects on time but for (team 6) even trying is futile, they are a hundred leagues behind. So they decided to unleash the cyberwarfare on their counterparts to pirate their work. Their plans were discovered and a raven was sent to notify other teams of their vile intentions to raise their defenses and get ready for the battle to come. In the game of deliveries, you win or you die, there is no middle ground. 

#Game description:
	“Project delivery” is a catch the flag type of gameplay where two teams, 3 players each clash to finish their incomplete projects by pirating other teams’ work while securing theirs. 
When the deadline comes, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives and thus team-work is essential at such times of distress. Each player in the team is a powerhouse in a certain field yet has his weaknesses. 
A team consists of 3 players, speed coder who is able to copy other people’s code at a dazzling speed, the strong debugger with his massive breakpoints-shooting bazooka who has the capability to hinder the target’s workflow, Mr. cipher with his reinforced shield protecting other team members during the attack.
The scoring system is based on the number of pirated files. A certain score grants the team a fourth member “Neo” whom magical skills enable the team to stealthily steal other teams’ code without being detected and then disappears.
